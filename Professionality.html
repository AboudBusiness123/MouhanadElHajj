          Hi Jamal,
          <br><br>
          Thank you for your edits to the illustrations of the characters for our video game storyboard. Their costumes
          now fit much more with their personalities.
          <br><br>
          I have re-edited the part of the story that you mentioned was too long, reducing the time needed in the game
          by half. Could you take a look at the attached file and let me know what you think?
          <br><br>
          How are you doing with the background in the second story? Let me know if you would like a meeting to talk it
          over later.
          <br><br>
          Best,

          <br>Body: Dear Patrick,
          <br><br>
          Thank you for your feedback on the character illustrations. I’m glad to hear the costume edits align better
          with their personalities.
          <br><br>
          I’ve reviewed the updated story file you attached, and I have a few questions for clarification to ensure my
          feedback aligns with your vision:
          Should I focus primarily on how the reduced story time impacts the overall pacing of the game?
          Are there any particular elements of the revised sections that you’d like me to pay closer attention to?
          <br><br>
          Regarding the background for the second story, I’m still working through some of the details and would
          appreciate discussing it further. A quick meeting to go over the specifics would be helpful. Please let me
          know your availability, and I’ll adjust accordingly.
